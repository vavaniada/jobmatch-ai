# JobMatch AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

JobMatch AI is an AI-powered project designed to help job seekers find the best job opportunities by matching their skills and preferences with employer requirements. The system analyzes resumes and job postings, generates personalized cover letters, and recommends the most suitable job matches.

## Background

Finding the right job can be a challenging and time-consuming process. Job seekers often struggle to find opportunities that match their skills and preferences, while employers have difficulty finding candidates that fit their requirements.

This project aims to:
* Simplify the job hunting process for job seekers.
* Improve the efficiency of the hiring process for employers.
* Provide personalized job recommendations and cover letters.

## How is it used?

JobMatch AI is used by job seekers to find matching job opportunities and by employers to identify suitable candidates. It benefits job seekers by providing personalized job recommendations and cover letters, and helps employers streamline their recruitment process.

### Usage Example

python match_jobs.py –candidates candidates.csv –jobs jobs.csv
python generate_cover_letter.py –candidate_id 1 –job_id 2
python recommend_jobs.py –candidate_id 1

## Data sources and AI methods

The data sources include:
* **Candidate Data**: Resumes, skills, and preferences.
* **Job Postings**: Job descriptions and requirements.

The AI techniques used are:
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For analyzing resumes and job descriptions.
* **Machine Learning**: For matching candidates with job postings.
* **Generative Models**: For creating personalized cover letters.

| Data Source  | Description            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Resumes      | Candidate information  |
| Job Postings | Job requirements       |

## Challenges

JobMatch AI does not solve the problem of data quality and completeness. Additionally, the model needs to adapt to different industries and job roles, which may require additional training data. Ethical considerations include ensuring privacy and fairness in job recommendations.

## What next?

To grow, JobMatch AI can:
* Expand data sources to include more comprehensive data from various job portals.
* Enhance matching algorithms for better accuracy.
* Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the system.
